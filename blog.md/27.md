# #Bug of LibreOffice Writer -- Adjust table clounm/row

## Info

Product: LibreOffice
Component: Writer
Version: 5.2.0.0.alpha0+ Master
Hardware: All All

## Descripthion

The table which is protected can not be adjusted table cloumn or row when the cursor is in the table.It is all right.
But when the cursor is not in a protected table, it can be adjusted table cloumn or row.
So I guess it is relative with the current cusor.
For examle: the A1 cell is protected, if the cursor is also in the A1 cell then it is can not be adjusted, but if the cusor is in the B2 cell it can be adjusted.
